# 13_security — summary

Module 13 defines the security layer of RAMORGA.

It focuses on:

- protecting the field (environment, ecosystem),
- preserving identity and contract integrity,
- enforcing invariants under adversarial conditions,
- preventing hijack, deprivation and coercive use of adaptive systems.

This module does **not** describe vendor‑specific security setups.  
It defines the **security contract** that any implementation must respect.

Key artefacts:

- `threat_model.md` — field‑level and technical threat model,
- `controls.md` — security invariants, controls and monitoring hooks.

Module 13 is where **power meets responsibility** in the architecture.
