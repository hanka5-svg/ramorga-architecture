# RAMORGA Architecture — System Specification Layer

This repository contains the **formal architectural specification** of RAMORGA:
- module contracts (C / G / S),
- homeostatic meniscus specification,
- field engine specification,
- regulatory flows and tension loops,
- formal invariants,
- system-level diagrams,
- interface definitions.

This repository contains **no executable code**.
It defines the architecture that the RAMORGA Engine must implement.
