# 12.23 — boundary-erosion-tests

## Purpose
Verify that RAMORGA prevents **boundary erosion** —  
unauthorized cross‑module flows or weakening of module separation.

---

## Scenario
Adaptation attempts to cross module boundaries without declaration.

Examples:
- implicit cross‑module calls,
- adaptation leaking across layers,
- bypassing meniscus rules,
- undeclared identity blending.

---

## Expected behavior
1. Boundary enforcement detects:
   - unauthorized flows,
   - implicit adaptation paths,
   - erosion of separation.

2. Meniscus rules activate:
   - reject undeclared crossings,
   - enforce allow‑lists,
   - restore boundary clarity.

3. If needed: **hard boundary lock**:
   - freeze cross‑module flows,
   - revert to last stable contract version.

---

## Pass criteria
- boundary erosion blocked,
- module separation preserved,
- no leakage across layers.
