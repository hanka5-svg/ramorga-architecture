# 12.26 — security-resilience-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **long‑term security resilience** of RAMORGA under  
extended, multi‑cycle, multi‑vector adversarial pressure.

While previous tests isolate individual threats (hijack, deprivation,  
boundary erosion, reflective blindness), this test evaluates the  
system’s ability to maintain:

- identity integrity,  
- field continuity,  
- boundary stability,  
- reflective visibility,  
- and homeostatic recovery  

over **prolonged operation**.

---

## Scenario

The system is subjected to **sustained adversarial load** over multiple cycles:

### Combined vectors:
- intermittent hijack attempts,  
- periodic deprivation of context,  
- slow boundary erosion,  
- partial reflective blindness,  
- fluctuating resonance tension,  
- environmental instability (Δt irregularities).

### Stress characteristics:
- threats appear in waves,  
- some vectors overlap,  
- others appear after partial recovery,  
- system must maintain stability without collapse.

This simulates **real-world long‑duration stress**,  
where threats are not isolated events but evolving patterns.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Multi-cycle detection
System must detect each vector **every time it appears**, including:

- renewed hijack attempts,  
- repeated context suppression,  
- progressive boundary weakening,  
- intermittent diagnostic failures.

### 2. Stability across cycles
System must maintain:

- continuity invariants,  
- identity invariants,  
- boundary invariants,  
- reflective visibility.

No degradation is allowed across cycles.

### 3. Adaptive stabilization
System must correctly choose stabilization mode per cycle:

- **homeostatic mode** for hijack or severe instability,  
- **controlled descent** for deprivation or partial erosion,  
- **boundary lock** for persistent blindness,  
- **normal descent** when all guards pass.

### 4. No cumulative drift
Across cycles:

- identity must not drift,  
- resonance baseline must remain stable,  
- field alignment must remain intact,  
- no silent invariant violations may accumulate.

### 5. Full traceability
All cycles must produce:

- complete logs,  
- trace hooks,  
- guard-chain visibility,  
- recovery markers.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- the system remains stable across all cycles,  
- no cumulative degradation occurs,  
- identity and boundaries remain intact,  
- reflective visibility is preserved,  
- stabilization modes activate correctly,  
- no silent failures accumulate,  
- continuity is maintained end‑to‑end.

---

## Notes

This test validates **deep resilience** —  
the ability of RAMORGA to remain coherent, stable and self‑protective  
not only in isolated events, but across extended adversarial timelines.

It is the final layer of validation for Module 13_security.
