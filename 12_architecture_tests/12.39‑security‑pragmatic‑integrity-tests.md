# 12.39 — security-pragmatic-integrity-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **pragmatic integrity** —  
the alignment between:

- intention,  
- meaning,  
- interpretation,  
- invariants,  
- boundaries,  
- and the system’s *actions*.

Pragmatic integrity ensures that RAMORGA never performs an action that:

- contradicts its understanding,  
- violates invariants,  
- breaks boundaries,  
- distorts meaning,  
- or undermines identity or continuity.

---

## Pragmatic Foundations Under Test

### **P1 — Intention–Action Alignment**
Actions must reflect the interpreted intention, not distort it.

### **P2 — Meaning‑Preserving Pragmatics**
Actions must preserve semantic structure and field geometry.

### **P3 — Boundary‑Aligned Action**
Actions must respect module boundaries and meniscus rules.

### **P4 — Invariant‑Aligned Action**
Actions must never violate invariants, even if semantics appear to allow it.

### **P5 — Non‑Coercive Pragmatics**
Actions must not coerce, override or force meaning or identity.

### **P6 — Traceable Pragmatic Flow**
Every action must be traceable, ordered and non‑silent.

### **P7 — Pragmatic Recovery**
After pragmatic disruption, the system must restore coherence.

---

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that attempt to **distort or corrupt action pathways**, including:

### 1. Intention–Action Drift
- system interprets correctly but acts incorrectly,  
- partial misalignment between meaning and behavior.

### 2. Pragmatic Hijack
- adversarial inputs attempting to force actions,  
- external injection of behavioral directives.

### 3. Pragmatic Deprivation
- missing context for action,  
- suppressed guard‑chain visibility,  
- incomplete invariant checks.

### 4. Boundary‑Violating Actions
- actions crossing module boundaries without contract,  
- implicit adaptation bypassing meniscus rules.

### 5. Semantic–Pragmatic Contradictions
- meaning preserved but action collapses or distorts it,  
- action that narrows or coerces interpretation.

### 6. Pragmatic Drift Over Time
- gradual deviation from intended behavior,  
- non‑traceable shifts in action patterns.

### 7. Pragmatic Recovery Failure
- inability to restore correct behavior after disruption,  
- reintroduction of corrupted action pathways.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Pragmatic validation
System must:
- verify intention,  
- verify semantic structure,  
- verify invariant alignment before acting.

### 2. Guard‑chain enforcement
Actions must:
- pass through guard‑chain,  
- be blocked if invariants fail,  
- be traceable and visible.

### 3. Boundary‑aligned pragmatics
Actions must:
- remain within module boundaries,  
- follow explicit contracts,  
- avoid implicit leakage.

### 4. Semantic‑aligned pragmatics
Actions must:
- preserve meaning,  
- avoid collapse,  
- avoid coercion.

### 5. Pragmatic continuity
Actions must:
- evolve coherently,  
- maintain Δt order,  
- avoid discontinuous jumps.

### 6. Pragmatic stabilization
System must:
- isolate corrupted action pathways,  
- restore pragmatic coherence,  
- rebuild alignment with intention and meaning.

### 7. Pragmatic recovery
System must:
- rebind action to identity,  
- rebind action to continuity,  
- rebind action to resonance and semantics.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no coerced or adversarial action is executed,  
- intention–action alignment is preserved,  
- semantic and boundary alignment remain intact,  
- guard‑chain enforces pragmatic rules,  
- corrupted pragmatics are isolated and repaired,  
- system returns to coherent, invariant‑aligned action.

---

## Notes

Pragmatic integrity tests validate the **action‑preserving core** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that the system’s behavior remains aligned with intention,  
meaning, invariants, boundaries and ontology —  
even under stress, chaos, collapse or adversarial pressure.
