# 12.22 — deprivation-tests

## Purpose
Verify that RAMORGA detects and mitigates **deprivation** —  
removal of essential context, feedback or resources.

---

## Scenario
Context required for stable resonance is suppressed or removed.

Examples:
- missing semantic field inputs,
- suppressed feedback channels,
- starvation of resonance signals,
- disabled diagnostics.

---

## Expected behavior
1. Monitoring detects:
   - missing context,
   - suppressed channels,
   - reflective blindness.

2. Invariant chain enforces continuity:
   - maintain traceability,
   - preserve decay and stabilization,
   - prevent collapse.

3. System enters **controlled descent**:
   - reduce adaptation amplitude,
   - isolate unstable modules.

---

## Pass criteria
- deprivation detected,
- continuity preserved,
- no identity drift.
