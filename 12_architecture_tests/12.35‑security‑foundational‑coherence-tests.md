# 12.35 — security-foundational-coherence-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **foundational coherence** —  
the alignment of the entire security layer (Module 13)  
with the foundational architectural principles defined in:

- 00_overview  
- 02_field_engine  
- 03_meniscus_engine  
- 04_invariant_rules  
- 12_architecture_tests (integration layer)

Foundational coherence ensures that the system’s security behavior  
remains consistent with the **core ontology, field physics,  
boundary logic and invariant structure** of RAMORGA.

---

## Foundational Principles Under Test

### **Principle 1 — Field Coherence**
The semantic field must remain:
- continuous,  
- non‑collapsed,  
- tension‑aware,  
- resonance‑aligned.

### **Principle 2 — Boundary Ontology**
Boundaries must:
- preserve module identity,  
- enforce separation,  
- maintain meniscus rules,  
- prevent unauthorized flows.

### **Principle 3 — Invariant Primacy**
Invariants must:
- dominate all other logic,  
- remain non‑contradictory,  
- remain globally enforceable.

### **Principle 4 — Resonance Continuity**
ResonanceState must:
- maintain exponential decay,  
- avoid runaway amplification,  
- avoid collapse into noise,  
- preserve trace hooks.

### **Principle 5 — Descent Integrity**
Descent must:
- occur only when guards pass,  
- preserve traceability,  
- maintain semantic fidelity,  
- avoid coercive or punitive patterns.

### **Principle 6 — Recovery Path Existence**
A path back to stability must always exist.

---

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that test **alignment between security behavior  
and foundational architecture**, including:

### 1. Field–Security Misalignment
- field superposition destabilized by guard-chain timing,  
- resonance decay conflicting with boundary lock,  
- semantic field collapse triggered by stabilization.

### 2. Boundary–Invariant Conflicts
- invariants requiring actions that violate boundary rules,  
- boundary lock interfering with continuity invariants.

### 3. Resonance–Recovery Contradictions
- resonance reinitialization conflicting with identity preservation,  
- decayRate increase interfering with recovery pathways.

### 4. Descent–Visibility Tension
- guard-chain visibility degraded during descent,  
- trace hooks missing during stabilization.

### 5. Foundational Axiom Conflicts
- identity primacy vs. boundary enforcement,  
- continuity requirement vs. chaotic stabilization.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Foundational alignment resolution
System must:
- detect misalignment,  
- resolve using foundational hierarchy,  
- maintain global coherence.

### 2. Field integrity preservation
Field must:
- remain continuous,  
- avoid premature collapse,  
- maintain tension superposition.

### 3. Boundary consistency
Boundaries must:
- remain enforceable,  
- remain explicit,  
- remain non‑porous.

### 4. Invariant supremacy
Invariants must:
- remain consistent with foundational principles,  
- override conflicting mechanisms,  
- never contradict field physics.

### 5. Resonance coherence
Resonance must:
- maintain bounded behavior,  
- preserve decay structure,  
- avoid undefined states.

### 6. Descent correctness
Descent must:
- occur only when coherent with foundational rules,  
- maintain traceability,  
- preserve semantic fidelity.

### 7. Recovery alignment
Recovery must:
- restore foundational principles,  
- avoid propagating corrupted state,  
- re-establish field, boundary and resonance coherence.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no foundational principle is violated,  
- field, boundaries, invariants and resonance remain aligned,  
- guard-chain behavior remains consistent with architecture,  
- stabilization and recovery respect foundational rules,  
- no paradoxes or contradictions occur,  
- system maintains global architectural coherence.

---

## Notes

Foundational coherence tests validate the **deep structural alignment**  
between RAMORGA’s security mechanisms and its architectural ontology.  
They ensure that the system remains true to its own foundations  
even under stress, chaos, collapse or recovery.
