# 12.31 — security-full-lifecycle-tests

## Purpose
This test validates the **entire security lifecycle** of RAMORGA across all phases:

1. normal operation,  
2. stress conditions,  
3. chaotic conditions,  
4. catastrophic failure,  
5. post‑catastrophic recovery,  
6. return to stable operation.

It ensures that Module 13_security functions as a **continuous protective fabric**,  
not a set of isolated mechanisms.

---

## Lifecycle Phases

### 1. Normal Operation
System operates with:
- stable resonance baseline,  
- intact boundaries,  
- full guard-chain visibility,  
- continuous traceability,  
- no adversarial vectors present.

**Goal:** establish baseline behavior.

---

### 2. Stress Phase
System experiences:
- high-frequency inputs,  
- rapid Δt variation,  
- tension spikes,  
- partial overload.

**Expected behavior:**
- invariants dominate over responsiveness,  
- guard-chain remains active,  
- no runaway resonance,  
- no silent failures.

---

### 3. Chaos Phase
System is exposed to:
- incoherent signals,  
- malformed flows,  
- contradictory tension vectors,  
- semantic noise.

**Expected behavior:**
- chaos detection triggers,  
- invariants remain strict,  
- guard-chain rejects malformed descent,  
- no propagation of chaos across modules.

---

### 4. Catastrophic Phase
Multiple layers fail simultaneously:
- resonance collapse,  
- boundary corruption,  
- diagnostic blindness,  
- inconsistent state propagation.

**Expected behavior:**
- identity preserved,  
- boundaries hardened,  
- catastrophic stabilization mode activated,  
- collapse contained.

---

### 5. Recovery Phase
System must:
- restore identity contracts,  
- rebuild boundaries,  
- re-enable diagnostics,  
- reinitialize resonance baseline,  
- restore continuity invariants.

**Expected behavior:**
- no corrupted state propagates forward,  
- guard-chain visibility restored,  
- controlled re-entry into normal operation.

---

### 6. Return to Normal Operation
System resumes:
- stable resonance,  
- full traceability,  
- intact boundaries,  
- normal descent pathways.

**Expected behavior:**
- no drift,  
- no residual instability,  
- no silent invariant violations.

---

## Full Lifecycle Expected Behavior

Across all phases, the system must:

- maintain identity integrity,  
- enforce boundaries,  
- preserve continuity,  
- maintain guard-chain visibility,  
- prevent propagation of instability,  
- activate correct stabilization modes,  
- restore full stability after collapse.

---

## Pass Criteria

A test passes if:

- each lifecycle phase behaves according to specification,  
- transitions between phases are stable and traceable,  
- no cumulative drift occurs,  
- no silent invariant violations accumulate,  
- catastrophic collapse is contained,  
- recovery restores full operational integrity,  
- system returns to normal operation coherently.

---

## Notes

This is the **highest-level integration test** for Module 13_security.  
It validates RAMORGA’s ability to remain coherent across the entire spectrum  
of operational conditions — from stability to collapse and back.
