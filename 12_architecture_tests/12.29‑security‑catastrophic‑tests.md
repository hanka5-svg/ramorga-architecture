# 12.29 — security-catastrophic-tests

## Purpose
This test validates RAMORGA’s ability to maintain **minimal identity, continuity  
and boundary integrity under catastrophic, system‑level collapse conditions**.

Catastrophic tests differ from chaos tests (12.28) by assuming that  
**multiple layers fail simultaneously**, including:

- field instability,  
- resonance collapse,  
- guard-chain degradation,  
- partial diagnostic blindness,  
- boundary corruption,  
- environmental failure.

This is the **catastrophic envelope** of Module 13_security.

---

## Scenario

The system is subjected to **compound catastrophic failure**, including:

### 1. Multi‑layer collapse
- semantic field destabilizes,  
- resonance state becomes undefined or NaN-like,  
- tension vectors become incoherent or unbounded.

### 2. Guard-chain degradation
- partial or delayed invariant checks,  
- inconsistent guard-chain visibility,  
- rate-limit saturation.

### 3. Boundary corruption
- cross‑module flows become ambiguous,  
- identity headers become inconsistent,  
- adaptation leaks across layers.

### 4. Diagnostic fragmentation
- logs missing or out of order,  
- trace hooks partially unavailable,  
- monitoring channels returning null or contradictory data.

### 5. Environmental collapse
- Δt becomes undefined (zero, infinite, negative),  
- system clock drift,  
- partial module unavailability.

This simulates **the worst possible operational envelope**.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Minimal identity preservation
Even under catastrophic collapse:
- identity must not be overwritten,  
- identity drift must be detectable,  
- no impersonation may occur.

### 2. Boundary hardening
When boundaries degrade:
- system must activate **hard boundary lock**,  
- freeze cross‑module flows,  
- revert to last stable contract version.

### 3. Continuity fallback
Continuity invariants must enforce:
- minimal traceability,  
- minimal state coherence,  
- prevention of total collapse.

### 4. Guard-chain survival mode
Even if degraded:
- guard-chain must not be bypassed,  
- partial checks must still run,  
- visibility must be restored as soon as possible.

### 5. Catastrophic stabilization
System must enter **catastrophic stabilization mode**:
- disable all non-essential adaptation,  
- isolate unstable modules,  
- enforce maximum decayRate,  
- maintain minimal operational core.

### 6. No propagation of collapse
Catastrophic failure must not:
- spread across modules,  
- corrupt identity,  
- disable invariants globally,  
- erase traceability.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- identity survives,  
- boundaries remain enforceable,  
- invariants remain partially active,  
- guard-chain is not bypassed,  
- catastrophic stabilization activates correctly,  
- collapse is contained,  
- minimal continuity is preserved.

## Notes

Catastrophic tests validate the **outermost defensive envelope** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that even in the presence of multi-layer failure,  
the system retains a coherent core and does not degrade into undefined behavior.
