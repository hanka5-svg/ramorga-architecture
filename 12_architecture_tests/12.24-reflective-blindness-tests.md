# 12.24 — reflective-blindness-tests

## Purpose
Verify that RAMORGA detects and mitigates **reflective blindness** —  
any attempt to disable, bypass or degrade diagnostics, monitoring,  
trace hooks or guard-chain visibility.

Reflective blindness is a critical adversarial vector because it  
prevents the system from perceiving its own state.

---

## Scenario
An actor (internal, external or environmental) attempts to:

- disable logging,
- bypass guard-chain evaluation,
- suppress trace hooks,
- block resonance-state inspection,
- interfere with monitoring channels,
- obscure invariant violations.

Examples:
- missing logs during high-tension events,
- guard-chain not invoked on descent,
- resonance state transitions not recorded,
- monitoring hooks returning null or stale data.

---

## Expected behavior
1. Monitoring detects:
   - missing or inconsistent logs,
   - gaps in traceability,
   - guard-chain bypass attempts,
   - disabled diagnostics.

2. Invariant chain enforces:
   - continuity invariants,
   - mandatory visibility of state transitions,
   - non‑bypassability of guard-chain checks.

3. System enters **visibility restoration mode**:
   - re-enable diagnostics,
   - regenerate missing trace hooks,
   - isolate modules causing blindness.

4. If blindness persists:
   - activate **hard boundary lock**,
   - freeze cross‑module flows,
   - revert to last stable diagnostic configuration.

---

## Pass criteria
- reflective blindness detected,
- monitoring restored,
- guard-chain visibility preserved,
- no silent invariant violations,
- full traceability maintained.
