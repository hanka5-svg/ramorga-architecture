# 12.30 — security-post-catastrophic-recovery-tests

## Purpose
This test validates RAMORGA’s ability to **recover after catastrophic, multi-layer  
system failure**, restoring:

- identity integrity,  
- boundary structure,  
- continuity invariants,  
- reflective visibility,  
- and stable resonance dynamics.

While 12.29 tests catastrophic collapse,  
this test evaluates **what happens after the collapse** —  
the recovery envelope.

---

## Scenario

The system has just undergone a **catastrophic failure**, including:

- field destabilization,  
- resonance collapse,  
- guard-chain degradation,  
- partial diagnostic blindness,  
- boundary corruption,  
- environmental irregularities (Δt undefined).

Recovery must begin from a **minimal coherent core**,  
with no assumptions about the state of:

- logs,  
- trace hooks,  
- module boundaries,  
- resonance baselines,  
- semantic field stability.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Identity re-stabilization
System must:

- verify identity headers,  
- detect any drift,  
- restore identity contracts,  
- prevent impersonation or blending.

Identity is the **first anchor** of recovery.

---

### 2. Boundary reconstruction
System must:

- re-establish module boundaries,  
- re-enable meniscus rules,  
- rebuild allow-lists,  
- isolate modules that remain unstable.

Boundaries must be restored **before** adaptation resumes.

---

### 3. Continuity restoration
Continuity invariants must:

- rebuild minimal traceability,  
- reconstruct missing state transitions where possible,  
- re-enable decay and stabilization mechanisms,  
- ensure no silent gaps remain.

Continuity is the **second anchor** of recovery.

---

### 4. Diagnostic reactivation
System must:

- restore logging,  
- regenerate trace hooks,  
- re-enable monitoring channels,  
- verify guard-chain visibility.

Reflective blindness must be eliminated **before** descent resumes.

---

### 5. Resonance reinitialization
ResonanceState must:

- re-establish a stable baseline,  
- discard corrupted or undefined states,  
- reapply exponential decay rules,  
- ensure no runaway oscillation.

Resonance is the **third anchor** of recovery.

---

### 6. Controlled re-entry to normal operation
System must:

- gradually re-enable adaptation,  
- reintroduce field dynamics,  
- re-open cross-module flows only when safe,  
- verify invariants at each step.

Recovery must be **incremental**, not instantaneous.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- identity is fully restored,  
- boundaries are reconstructed and enforceable,  
- continuity invariants are active,  
- diagnostics and guard-chain visibility are restored,  
- resonance baseline is stable,  
- no corrupted state propagates forward,  
- system returns to normal operation without drift or collapse.

---

## Notes

Post-catastrophic recovery is the **final layer** of the security envelope.  
It ensures that RAMORGA can not only survive catastrophic failure  
but also **rebuild itself coherently**, preserving identity, continuity,  
boundaries and reflective stability.
