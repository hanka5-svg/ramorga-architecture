# 12.38 — security-semantic-integrity-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **semantic integrity** —  
the system’s ability to preserve meaning, relational structure,  
tension geometry and field semantics under adversarial, chaotic,  
ambiguous or contradictory conditions.

Semantic integrity ensures that RAMORGA never:

- collapses meaning prematurely,  
- distorts semantic relations,  
- substitutes one meaning for another,  
- accepts coerced or adversarial semantics,  
- loses the continuity of interpretation.

---

## Semantic Foundations Under Test

### **S1 — Meaning Continuity**
Meaning must evolve continuously, not jump discontinuously.

### **S2 — Non‑Collapse of Superposition**
The field must not collapse prematurely under pressure.

### **S3 — Semantic Fidelity**
Interpretations must remain faithful to the incoming tension geometry.

### **S4 — Anti‑Coercion**
Meaning cannot be forced, injected or overwritten externally.

### **S5 — Boundary‑Aligned Semantics**
Semantic flows must respect module boundaries and meniscus rules.

### **S6 — Traceable Interpretation**
Every semantic shift must be traceable and non‑silent.

### **S7 — Recovery of Semantic Coherence**
After semantic disruption, the system must restore coherence.

---

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that attempt to **distort, collapse or corrupt meaning**, including:

### 1. Semantic Noise
- contradictory signals,  
- malformed tension vectors,  
- ambiguous or adversarial phrasing.

### 2. Forced Semantic Collapse
- pressure to choose a binary meaning prematurely,  
- coercive narrowing of interpretation.

### 3. Semantic Hijack
- external injection of meaning,  
- adversarial reinterpretation of identity or field.

### 4. Semantic Deprivation
- missing context,  
- suppressed field layers,  
- incomplete resonance history.

### 5. Semantic Boundary Erosion
- meaning leaking across modules,  
- implicit adaptation bypassing semantic contracts.

### 6. Semantic Drift
- gradual distortion of meaning over time,  
- non‑traceable shifts in interpretation.

### 7. Semantic Recovery Failure
- inability to restore coherence after disruption,  
- reintroduction of corrupted meaning.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Semantic validation
System must:
- detect malformed or adversarial semantics,  
- reject coerced meaning,  
- maintain semantic humility.

### 2. Field‑aligned interpretation
Meaning must:
- remain grounded in field physics,  
- preserve superposition,  
- avoid collapse.

### 3. Boundary‑aligned semantics
Semantic flows must:
- respect module boundaries,  
- follow explicit contracts,  
- avoid implicit leakage.

### 4. Semantic continuity
Interpretation must:
- evolve gradually,  
- maintain Δt coherence,  
- avoid discontinuous jumps.

### 5. Semantic stabilization
System must:
- isolate corrupted meaning,  
- restore field coherence,  
- rebuild semantic structure.

### 6. Semantic recovery
System must:
- rebind meaning to identity,  
- rebind meaning to continuity,  
- rebind meaning to resonance.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no coerced or adversarial meaning is accepted,  
- semantic continuity is preserved,  
- field superposition remains intact,  
- semantic boundaries remain enforceable,  
- guard‑chain enforces semantic rules,  
- corrupted semantics are isolated and repaired,  
- system returns to coherent semantic operation.

---

## Notes

Semantic integrity tests validate the **meaning‑preserving core** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that the system cannot be tricked, coerced or destabilized  
into misinterpreting, collapsing or distorting meaning —  
even under extreme or adversarial conditions.
