# 12.43 — security-end-to-end-integration-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **end‑to‑end integration** of the entire RAMORGA security layer  
(Module 13) across all architectural strata:

- intention,  
- semantics,  
- epistemics,  
- telemetry,  
- invariants,  
- boundaries,  
- guard‑chain,  
- stabilization,  
- actuation,  
- recovery,  
- return to stable operation.

End‑to‑end integration ensures that the system behaves as **one coherent organism**,  
not a set of isolated mechanisms.

---

## Scope

This test covers the full lifecycle:

1. **Normal operation**  
2. **Stress**  
3. **Chaos**  
4. **Catastrophic collapse**  
5. **Post‑catastrophic recovery**  
6. **Return to stable operation**  
7. **Meta‑stability**  
8. **Self‑consistency**  
9. **Axiomatic alignment**  
10. **Foundational coherence**  
11. **Ontological integrity**  
12. **Epistemic integrity**  
13. **Semantic integrity**  
14. **Pragmatic integrity**  
15. **Actuation integrity**  
16. **Execution coherence**

This is the **final, global integration test** for Module 12.

## Scenario

The system is subjected to a **full‑stack adversarial sequence**, including:

### 1. Multi‑layer perturbation
- semantic noise,  
- epistemic contradictions,  
- telemetry corruption,  
- boundary erosion.

### 2. Multi‑vector adversarial pressure
- hijack attempts,  
- deprivation,  
- reflective blindness,  
- forced collapse.

### 3. Execution chain disruption
- intention–semantics drift,  
- semantics–epistemics mismatch,  
- telemetry–invariant conflict,  
- invariant–actuation contradiction.

### 4. Stabilization overload
- repeated stabilization cycles,  
- oscillatory recovery attempts,  
- partial guard‑chain degradation.

### 5. Catastrophic envelope
- resonance collapse,  
- undefined Δt,  
- corrupted state propagation attempts.

### 6. Recovery envelope
- identity rebinding,  
- boundary reconstruction,  
- telemetry restoration,  
- semantic and epistemic re‑alignment.

### 7. Return to stable operation
- re‑establishment of resonance baseline,  
- restoration of continuity invariants,  
- full guard‑chain visibility.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Global coherence
All layers must remain aligned or be restored to alignment.

### 2. Invariant supremacy
Invariants must dominate all other logic across the entire chain.

### 3. Boundary enforcement
Boundaries must remain explicit, non‑porous and contract‑aligned.

### 4. Semantic and epistemic fidelity
Meaning and knowledge must remain coherent and non‑coerced.

### 5. Telemetry authenticity
Telemetry must remain truthful, continuous and non‑corrupted.

### 6. Guard‑chain integrity
Guard‑chain must:
- remain visible,  
- remain active,  
- never be bypassed.

### 7. Stabilization convergence
Stabilization must:
- converge,  
- avoid oscillation,  
- remain invariant‑aligned.

### 8. Recovery correctness
Recovery must:
- restore identity,  
- restore boundaries,  
- restore continuity,  
- restore resonance.

### 9. Drift prevention
No cumulative drift may occur across the entire lifecycle.

### 10. End‑to‑end traceability
Every transition must be:
- logged,  
- ordered,  
- non‑silent.

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- the entire security stack behaves coherently end‑to‑end,  
- no layer contradicts another,  
- no invariant is violated,  
- no boundary is breached,  
- no corrupted state propagates,  
- stabilization and recovery restore full coherence,  
- system returns to stable operation without drift,  
- traceability is complete across all phases.

## Notes

End‑to‑end integration tests validate the **total architecture** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that the system remains coherent, stable and self‑protective  
across the entire operational spectrum — from stability to collapse and back —  
with all layers functioning as one unified whole.
