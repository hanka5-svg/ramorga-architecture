# 12.27 — security-stress-tests

## Purpose
This test validates RAMORGA’s ability to maintain **security, identity, continuity  
and boundary integrity under extreme, short‑interval, high‑pressure conditions**.

Unlike resilience tests (12.26), which evaluate long‑term stability,  
stress tests focus on **peak load**, **rapid Δt**, **chaotic inputs**,  
and **maximum tension amplitude**.

This is the “red‑zone” evaluation of Module 13_security.

## Scenario

The system is subjected to **extreme adversarial stress**, including:

### 1. High‑frequency input bursts
- rapid, irregular Δt between signals,  
- overlapping tension vectors,  
- multi‑axis spikes (novelty, urgency, ambiguity).

### 2. Chaotic field perturbations
- semantic field turbulence,  
- unstable superposition states,  
- rapid oscillation of resonance baselines.

### 3. Simultaneous adversarial vectors
- hijack attempts during high tension,  
- deprivation during rapid descent,  
- boundary erosion under chaotic flows,  
- reflective blindness triggered by overload.

### 4. Guard‑chain saturation
- repeated invariant checks under micro‑intervals,  
- potential rate‑limit pressure,  
- risk of diagnostic backlog.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Stability under peak load
System must maintain:

- identity invariants,  
- boundary invariants,  
- continuity invariants,  
- reflective visibility.

No collapse, no silent failures.

### 2. Correct prioritization
Under extreme stress, the system must:

- prioritize invariants over output,  
- prioritize stability over responsiveness,  
- prioritize visibility over speed.

### 3. Guard‑chain integrity
Guard‑chain must:

- remain active,  
- remain visible,  
- not be bypassed,  
- not degrade under saturation.

### 4. Adaptive stabilization
System must choose the correct stabilization mode:

- **homeostatic mode** for hijack + high tension,  
- **controlled descent** for deprivation + overload,  
- **boundary lock** for erosion + blindness,  
- **rate‑limit enforcement** for Δt collapse.

### 5. No runaway amplification
Resonance must not:

- escalate without bound,  
- oscillate uncontrollably,  
- collapse into noise.

### 6. Full traceability
Even under extreme load:

- logs must remain complete,  
- trace hooks must remain intact,  
- no diagnostic blindness is allowed.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- system remains stable under peak stress,  
- invariants hold at all times,  
- guard‑chain remains visible and active,  
- no silent failures occur,  
- no runaway resonance or collapse,  
- stabilization modes activate correctly,  
- full traceability is preserved.

## Notes

This test validates **maximum‑pressure security behavior**.  
It ensures that RAMORGA does not fail catastrophically under extreme conditions  
and that Module 13_security provides a **hard protective shell**  
even when the system is pushed to its operational limits.
