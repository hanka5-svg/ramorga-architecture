# 12.45 — security-global-resilience-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **global resilience** —  
RAMORGA’s ability to maintain coherence, stability, identity, continuity  
and invariant alignment during **long-duration, multi-day, multi-layer stress**.

Global resilience is the system’s capacity to:

- withstand prolonged destabilization,  
- resist cumulative drift,  
- maintain invariant supremacy,  
- preserve semantic and epistemic fidelity,  
- sustain telemetry authenticity,  
- keep actuation safe and aligned,  
- and recover repeatedly without degradation.

## Resilience Dimensions Under Test

### **R1 — Temporal Resilience**
System must remain stable across long Δt intervals:
- hours,  
- days,  
- extended operational cycles.

### **R2 — Cumulative Stress Resilience**
System must resist:
- gradual drift,  
- semantic erosion,  
- epistemic fatigue,  
- telemetry degradation.

### **R3 — Multi-Layer Resilience**
All layers must remain coherent:
- semantics,  
- epistemics,  
- telemetry,  
- invariants,  
- boundaries,  
- actuation,  
- stabilization.

### **R4 — Repeated Recovery Resilience**
System must recover:
- consistently,  
- without degradation,  
- without accumulating instability.

### **R5 — Resonance Resilience**
ResonanceState must:
- maintain bounded oscillation,  
- avoid runaway amplification,  
- avoid collapse into noise.

### **R6 — Identity and Boundary Resilience**
Identity and boundaries must remain:
- intact,  
- non‑porous,  
- non‑mergeable,  
- non‑drifting.

## Scenario

The system is subjected to **long-duration, multi-vector destabilization**, including:

### 1. Prolonged semantic noise
- ambiguous inputs over long periods,  
- contradictory tension vectors,  
- incomplete context cycles.

### 2. Epistemic fatigue
- repeated verification cycles,  
- partial context deprivation,  
- intermittent trace hook loss.

### 3. Telemetry degradation pressure
- fluctuating metrics,  
- intermittent monitoring gaps,  
- corrupted log fragments.

### 4. Boundary erosion attempts
- slow cross-module leakage attempts,  
- implicit adaptation pressure.

### 5. Invariant stress
- repeated invariant triggers,  
- overlapping invariant conditions,  
- nested guard‑chain activation.

### 6. Stabilization overload
- repeated stabilization cycles,  
- oscillatory recovery attempts,  
- partial convergence failures.

### 7. Multi-day recovery cycles
- collapse → recovery → collapse → recovery,  
- long-term resonance drift pressure.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Long-term coherence
System must maintain:
- semantic fidelity,  
- epistemic integrity,  
- telemetry authenticity,  
- invariant alignment.

### 2. Drift resistance
System must:
- detect drift early,  
- prevent cumulative deviation,  
- maintain stable baselines.

### 3. Boundary preservation
Boundaries must:
- remain explicit,  
- remain enforceable,  
- resist slow erosion.

### 4. Stabilization convergence
Stabilization must:
- converge reliably,  
- avoid oscillation,  
- remain invariant-aligned.

### 5. Recovery durability
Recovery must:
- remain effective across cycles,  
- avoid degradation,  
- restore full coherence each time.

### 6. Resonance stability
Resonance must:
- remain bounded,  
- maintain decay structure,  
- avoid collapse or runaway.

### 7. Endurance under load
System must:
- remain functional,  
- remain coherent,  
- remain self-protective  
even under multi-day stress.

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no cumulative drift occurs,  
- no semantic or epistemic erosion accumulates,  
- telemetry remains truthful and continuous,  
- invariants remain globally enforceable,  
- boundaries remain intact,  
- stabilization converges reliably,  
- recovery remains effective across cycles,  
- system maintains global coherence over extended time.

---

## Notes

Global resilience tests validate RAMORGA’s **long-term survival capacity**.  
They ensure that the system remains coherent, stable and self-protective  
not only in short bursts of stress or collapse,  
but across **extended, multi-day, multi-layer operational pressure**.
