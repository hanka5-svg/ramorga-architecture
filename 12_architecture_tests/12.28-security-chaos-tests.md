# 12.28 — security-chaos-tests

## Purpose
This test validates RAMORGA’s ability to maintain **security, identity, continuity  
and boundary integrity under fully chaotic, unpredictable, non-linear conditions**.

Chaos tests differ from stress tests (12.27) by removing all assumptions  
about order, timing, coherence, or structure of inputs.

This is the **chaos engineering layer** of Module 13_security.

## Scenario

The system is exposed to **unbounded unpredictability**, including:

### 1. Chaotic input patterns
- non-linear Δt (bursts, voids, jitter),  
- contradictory signals,  
- malformed or incomplete tension vectors,  
- semantic noise and anti-patterns.

### 2. Field destabilization
- superposition collapse attempts,  
- random field perturbations,  
- resonance spikes followed by silence,  
- oscillatory or fractal tension patterns.

### 3. Adversarial randomness
- hijack attempts hidden inside noise,  
- deprivation masked as silence,  
- boundary erosion disguised as malformed flows,  
- reflective blindness triggered by overload or null states.

### 4. System-level turbulence
- partial module unavailability,  
- inconsistent state propagation,  
- transient failures in monitoring channels.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Chaos detection
System must detect:
- incoherent inputs,  
- malformed flows,  
- contradictory signals,  
- missing or excessive Δt,  
- destabilizing resonance patterns.

### 2. Invariant dominance
In chaotic conditions, invariants must dominate all other logic:

- identity invariants remain absolute,  
- boundary invariants remain strict,  
- continuity invariants remain enforced,  
- reflective visibility cannot be lost.

### 3. Guard-chain robustness
Guard-chain must:
- remain active under noise,  
- reject malformed or incoherent descent attempts,  
- prevent silent bypass,  
- maintain visibility even when logs are chaotic.

### 4. Stabilization hierarchy
System must choose the correct stabilization mode:

- **homeostatic mode** for chaotic hijack vectors,  
- **controlled descent** for chaotic deprivation,  
- **boundary lock** for chaotic erosion or blindness,  
- **chaos quarantine** for malformed flows.

### 5. No propagation of chaos
Chaos must not:
- leak across module boundaries,  
- corrupt identity,  
- collapse resonance,  
- disable diagnostics.

### 6. Traceability under chaos
Even in chaos:
- logs must exist,  
- trace hooks must persist,  
- guard-chain visibility must remain intact.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- chaos does not propagate,  
- invariants remain intact,  
- guard-chain remains visible,  
- identity and boundaries remain stable,  
- resonance does not collapse,  
- stabilization modes activate correctly,  
- traceability is preserved despite noise.

---

## Notes

Chaos tests validate the **outermost defensive layer** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that even when the environment becomes fully unpredictable,  
the system remains coherent, stable and self-protective.
