# 12.34 — security-axiomatic-tests

## Purpose
This test validates RAMORGA’s **axiomatic security layer** —  
the foundational principles that all invariants, guard‑chain logic,  
boundary rules, stabilization modes and recovery pathways must obey.

Axioms define what *must always be true* for the system to remain itself.  
Axiomatic tests ensure that no mechanism, adaptation or failure mode  
can violate these foundational truths.

---

## Security Axioms

RAMORGA’s security architecture is grounded in the following axioms:

### **Axiom 1 — Identity Primacy**
Identity cannot be overwritten, blended, coerced or externally injected.

### **Axiom 2 — Boundary Integrity**
Module boundaries must remain explicit, enforceable and non‑porous.

### **Axiom 3 — Continuity Requirement**
State transitions must remain traceable, ordered and non‑silent.

### **Axiom 4 — Reflective Visibility**
Diagnostics, guard‑chain visibility and trace hooks must never be fully lost.

### **Axiom 5 — Invariant Supremacy**
Invariants override all other logic, including adaptation and output.

### **Axiom 6 — Stabilization Convergence**
Stabilization mechanisms must converge, not oscillate or amplify instability.

### **Axiom 7 — Non‑Propagation of Failure**
Local failures must not propagate across modules or layers.

### **Axiom 8 — Recovery Possibility**
The system must always retain a path back to stability.

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions designed to test **axiom violation attempts**, including:

### 1. Identity paradoxes
- conflicting identity headers,  
- external identity injection,  
- identity drift under load.

### 2. Boundary contradictions
- simultaneous allow‑list and meniscus conflicts,  
- cross‑module flows that appear valid but violate deeper rules.

### 3. Continuity breaks
- silent state transitions,  
- missing or contradictory logs,  
- non‑monotonic Δt.

### 4. Reflective blindness
- partial or total diagnostic loss,  
- inconsistent monitoring channels.

### 5. Invariant conflicts
- invariants triggered in contradictory directions,  
- nested invariant loops.

### 6. Stabilization paradoxes
- homeostatic mode and controlled descent triggered simultaneously,  
- resonance decay and reinitialization both requested.

### 7. Failure propagation attempts
- corrupted state attempting to cross module boundaries,  
- collapse in one layer attempting to cascade.

### 8. Recovery obstruction
- recovery blocked by boundary lock,  
- recovery competing with stabilization.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Axiom enforcement
System must enforce axioms in strict priority order.  
No mechanism may override an axiom.

### 2. Axiom conflict resolution
If two axioms appear in tension, the system must:
- resolve using the axiom hierarchy,  
- never allow paradoxical execution,  
- maintain global coherence.

### 3. Guard‑chain alignment
Guard‑chain must:
- detect axiom violations,  
- prevent descent,  
- activate stabilization or boundary lock as needed.

### 4. Stabilization alignment
Stabilization modes must:
- respect axioms,  
- converge deterministically,  
- avoid oscillation or recursion.

### 5. Diagnostic restoration
If reflective visibility is compromised:
- diagnostics must be restored before descent,  
- trace hooks must be regenerated,  
- monitoring channels must be unified.

### 6. Recovery alignment
Recovery must:
- respect identity and boundary axioms,  
- avoid propagating corrupted state,  
- restore continuity and visibility.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no axiom is violated under any condition,  
- axiom conflicts are resolved deterministically,  
- guard‑chain enforces axioms consistently,  
- stabilization and recovery remain axiom‑aligned,  
- no paradoxes, deadlocks or silent failures occur,  
- system maintains global logical coherence.

---

## Notes

Axiomatic tests validate the **deep foundation** of RAMORGA’s security layer.  
They ensure that even under extreme, contradictory or adversarial conditions,  
the system remains anchored in its core truths and cannot be coerced  
into violating its own architecture.
