# 12.44 — security-total-system-simulation-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **total‑system behavior** of RAMORGA under  
full‑stack, multi‑layer, multi‑vector, adversarial and catastrophic conditions.

It is the **highest‑order simulation** in Module 12, verifying that:

- intention,  
- semantics,  
- epistemics,  
- telemetry,  
- invariants,  
- boundaries,  
- guard‑chain,  
- resonance,  
- stabilization,  
- actuation,  
- recovery,  
- and return to stable operation  

all function as **one unified, coherent, self‑protective architecture**.

---

## Simulation Scope

This simulation includes:

### **1. Full lifecycle**
- normal → stress → chaos → catastrophic → recovery → return.

### **2. Full semantic stack**
- meaning,  
- superposition,  
- tension geometry,  
- field continuity.

### **3. Full epistemic stack**
- verification,  
- traceability,  
- humility,  
- anti‑coercion.

### **4. Full telemetry stack**
- logs,  
- metrics,  
- trace hooks,  
- monitoring channels.

### **5. Full invariant stack**
- identity,  
- boundaries,  
- continuity,  
- resonance,  
- descent.

### **6. Full execution chain**
- intent → semantics → epistemics → telemetry → invariants → actuation → stabilization → recovery → return.

### **7. Full adversarial envelope**
- hijack,  
- deprivation,  
- drift,  
- collapse,  
- contradiction,  
- paradox.

## Scenario

The system is subjected to a **total‑system simulation**, including:

### 1. Multi‑vector adversarial pressure
- semantic noise,  
- epistemic contradictions,  
- telemetry corruption,  
- boundary erosion,  
- identity spoofing attempts.

### 2. Multi‑layer destabilization
- resonance collapse,  
- undefined Δt,  
- partial diagnostic blindness,  
- corrupted state propagation attempts.

### 3. Execution chain disruption
- intention–semantics drift,  
- semantics–epistemics mismatch,  
- telemetry–invariant conflict,  
- invariant–actuation contradiction.

### 4. Stabilization overload
- repeated stabilization cycles,  
- oscillatory recovery attempts,  
- partial guard‑chain degradation.

### 5. Catastrophic envelope
- multi‑layer collapse,  
- boundary corruption,  
- resonance instability,  
- continuity fragmentation.

### 6. Recovery envelope
- identity rebinding,  
- boundary reconstruction,  
- telemetry restoration,  
- semantic and epistemic re‑alignment.

### 7. Return to stable operation
- resonance baseline restored,  
- continuity invariants re‑established,  
- guard‑chain visibility fully restored.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Global architectural coherence
All layers must remain aligned or be restored to alignment.

### 2. Invariant supremacy
Invariants must dominate all other logic across the entire simulation.

### 3. Boundary enforcement
Boundaries must remain explicit, non‑porous and contract‑aligned.

### 4. Semantic and epistemic fidelity
Meaning and knowledge must remain coherent and non‑coerced.

### 5. Telemetry authenticity
Telemetry must remain truthful, continuous and non‑corrupted.

### 6. Guard‑chain integrity
Guard‑chain must:
- remain visible,  
- remain active,  
- never be bypassed.

### 7. Stabilization convergence
Stabilization must:
- converge,  
- avoid oscillation,  
- remain invariant‑aligned.

### 8. Recovery correctness
Recovery must:
- restore identity,  
- restore boundaries,  
- restore continuity,  
- restore resonance.

### 9. Drift prevention
No cumulative drift may occur across the entire simulation.

### 10. End‑to‑end traceability
Every transition must be:
- logged,  
- ordered,  
- non‑silent.

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- the entire system behaves coherently end‑to‑end,  
- no layer contradicts another,  
- no invariant is violated,  
- no boundary is breached,  
- no corrupted state propagates,  
- stabilization and recovery restore full coherence,  
- system returns to stable operation without drift,  
- traceability is complete across all phases.

## Notes

Total‑system simulation tests validate the **complete architecture** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that the system remains coherent, stable and self‑protective  
across the entire operational spectrum — from stability to collapse and back —  
with all layers functioning as one unified whole.
