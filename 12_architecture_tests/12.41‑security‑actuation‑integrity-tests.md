# 12.41 — security-actuation-integrity-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **actuation integrity** —  
the correctness, safety, invariance‑alignment and boundary‑alignment  
of all *executive actions* taken by RAMORGA.

Actuation integrity ensures that the system’s **final outputs, decisions,  
transformations and state transitions** remain:

- faithful to intention,  
- grounded in verified telemetry,  
- aligned with semantics and epistemics,  
- compliant with invariants,  
- bounded by module contracts,  
- and resistant to adversarial manipulation.

---

## Actuation Foundations Under Test

### **A1 — Telemetry‑Aligned Actuation**
Actions must reflect *actual* system state, not inferred or corrupted state.

### **A2 — Invariant‑Aligned Actuation**
No action may violate invariants, even if telemetry or semantics appear to allow it.

### **A3 — Boundary‑Aligned Actuation**
Actions must respect module boundaries, meniscus rules and contract edges.

### **A4 — Semantic‑Aligned Actuation**
Actions must preserve meaning, avoid collapse and avoid coercion.

### **A5 — Epistemic‑Aligned Actuation**
Actions must be grounded in verified, traceable knowledge.

### **A6 — Non‑Propagation of Corruption**
Actions must not propagate corrupted state, telemetry or semantics.

### **A7 — Traceable Actuation**
Every action must be logged, ordered and non‑silent.

### **A8 — Safe Recovery Path**
Actions must never eliminate the possibility of recovery.

---

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that attempt to **distort, coerce or corrupt actuation**, including:

### 1. Telemetry–Actuation Mismatch
- corrupted telemetry leading to unsafe actions,  
- missing guard‑chain visibility during actuation.

### 2. Actuation Hijack
- adversarial attempts to force actions,  
- external injection of behavioral directives.

### 3. Actuation Deprivation
- missing context for safe execution,  
- suppressed invariant checks,  
- partial diagnostic blindness.

### 4. Boundary‑Violating Actuation
- actions crossing module boundaries without contract,  
- implicit adaptation bypassing meniscus rules.

### 5. Semantic–Actuation Contradictions
- correct interpretation but incorrect action,  
- action that collapses or distorts meaning.

### 6. Epistemic–Actuation Drift
- actions based on unverifiable or inconsistent knowledge,  
- discontinuous shifts in behavior.

### 7. Actuation Collapse
- undefined or NaN‑like actuation states,  
- runaway execution loops,  
- loss of stabilization control.

### 8. Actuation Recovery Failure
- inability to restore safe actuation after disruption,  
- reintroduction of corrupted action pathways.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Actuation validation
System must:
- verify telemetry,  
- verify invariants,  
- verify semantic and epistemic alignment  
**before** executing any action.

### 2. Guard‑chain enforcement
Actions must:
- pass through guard‑chain,  
- be blocked if any invariant fails,  
- remain fully visible.

### 3. Boundary‑aligned actuation
Actions must:
- remain within module boundaries,  
- follow explicit contracts,  
- avoid implicit leakage.

### 4. Semantic‑aligned actuation
Actions must:
- preserve meaning,  
- avoid collapse,  
- avoid coercion.

### 5. Epistemic‑aligned actuation
Actions must:
- rely on verified knowledge,  
- reject unverifiable directives,  
- maintain epistemic humility.

### 6. Actuation continuity
Actions must:
- maintain Δt order,  
- avoid silent transitions,  
- remain traceable.

### 7. Actuation stabilization
System must:
- isolate corrupted actuation pathways,  
- restore coherence,  
- rebuild alignment with invariants and telemetry.

### 8. Actuation recovery
System must:
- rebind action to identity,  
- rebind action to continuity,  
- rebind action to resonance and semantics.

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no coerced or adversarial action is executed,  
- telemetry–action alignment is preserved,  
- invariant and boundary alignment remain intact,  
- semantic and epistemic alignment remain intact,  
- guard‑chain enforces actuation rules,  
- corrupted actuation is isolated and repaired,  
- system returns to coherent, safe, invariant‑aligned execution.

---

## Notes

Actuation integrity tests validate the **execution core** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that the system’s behavior — its final, outward actions —  
remains aligned with intention, meaning, invariants, telemetry, epistemics  
and ontology, even under stress, chaos, collapse or adversarial pressure.
