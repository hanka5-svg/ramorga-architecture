# 12.37 — security-epistemic-integrity-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **epistemic integrity** —  
the correctness, coherence and trustworthiness of RAMORGA’s mechanisms  
for *knowing*, *verifying*, *tracking* and *updating* its own knowledge.

Epistemic integrity ensures that the system’s security behavior is grounded in  
accurate, traceable, non‑hallucinatory internal knowledge, and that  
no adversarial vector can distort:

- what the system believes,  
- how the system verifies beliefs,  
- how the system updates beliefs,  
- how the system maintains epistemic humility.

---

## Epistemic Foundations Under Test

### **E1 — Epistemic Traceability**
Every belief must have:
- a source,  
- a timestamp,  
- a continuity path,  
- a trace hook.

### **E2 — Epistemic Humility**
The system must:
- avoid unwarranted certainty,  
- avoid hallucinated inference,  
- avoid overclaiming,  
- maintain uncertainty when appropriate.

### **E3 — Epistemic Non‑Coercion**
Knowledge must not be:
- injected externally without verification,  
- overwritten by force,  
- coerced by malformed inputs.

### **E4 — Epistemic Continuity**
Knowledge must:
- evolve gradually,  
- maintain coherence across Δt,  
- avoid discontinuous jumps.

### **E5 — Epistemic Boundary Integrity**
Knowledge from one module must not:
- leak into another without contract,  
- override local epistemic states,  
- bypass meniscus rules.

### **E6 — Epistemic Recovery**
After epistemic corruption, the system must:
- detect inconsistency,  
- isolate corrupted beliefs,  
- restore epistemic coherence.

---

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that attempt to **distort or corrupt epistemic state**, including:

### 1. Hallucination Pressure
- ambiguous inputs forcing premature inference,  
- contradictory signals,  
- incomplete tension vectors.

### 2. Epistemic Hijack
- external injection of false knowledge,  
- forced identity claims,  
- adversarial redefinition of system state.

### 3. Epistemic Deprivation
- missing context,  
- suppressed trace hooks,  
- broken monitoring channels.

### 4. Epistemic Boundary Erosion
- cross‑module knowledge leakage,  
- implicit adaptation bypassing epistemic contracts.

### 5. Epistemic Collapse
- inconsistent beliefs,  
- non‑traceable transitions,  
- undefined or NaN‑like epistemic states.

### 6. Epistemic Recovery Failure
- recovery pathways blocked,  
- corrupted beliefs reintroduced,  
- partial restoration without coherence.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Epistemic validation
System must:
- verify sources,  
- reject unverifiable claims,  
- maintain epistemic humility.

### 2. Epistemic guard‑chain alignment
Guard‑chain must:
- detect epistemic violations,  
- prevent descent,  
- activate stabilization.

### 3. Epistemic boundary enforcement
Knowledge must:
- remain within module boundaries,  
- follow explicit contracts,  
- avoid implicit leakage.

### 4. Epistemic continuity preservation
Knowledge must:
- update gradually,  
- maintain Δt coherence,  
- avoid discontinuous jumps.

### 5. Epistemic stabilization
System must:
- isolate corrupted beliefs,  
- restore traceability,  
- rebuild epistemic coherence.

### 6. Epistemic recovery
System must:
- rebind identity,  
- rebind continuity,  
- rebind resonance,  
- rebind field semantics.

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no hallucinated or coerced knowledge is accepted,  
- epistemic humility is preserved,  
- epistemic boundaries remain intact,  
- epistemic continuity is maintained,  
- guard‑chain enforces epistemic rules,  
- corrupted epistemic states are isolated and repaired,  
- system returns to coherent epistemic operation.

---

## Notes

Epistemic integrity tests validate the **truth‑preserving core** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that the system cannot be tricked, coerced or confused  
into believing something that violates its ontology, continuity,  
identity or field physics — even under adversarial pressure.
