# RAMORGA – Architectural Invariants

This document defines the 10 core architectural invariants that RAMORGA must uphold.  
They govern how the architecture behaves as a field, from superposition to linear representation and relational interaction.

---

## Invariant 1: Superposition Preservation

**Definition**  
The architecture must preserve multidimensional semantic space until a human measurement occurs.  
No module may collapse or pre-reduce the field before a user-initiated query.

**Requirements**

- Preserve multidimensional state.
- No premature collapse.
- No heuristic linearization before measurement.

---

## Invariant 2: Human-Initiated Measurement

**Definition**  
Only the human query may trigger reduction from superposition to a single line of output.  
The system must not infer, impose, or pre-select intent.

**Requirements**

- Measurement is triggered only by explicit user input.
- No autonomous intent inference.
- No unsolicited context injection.

---

## Invariant 3: Non-Deforming Reduction (Zapis)

**Definition**  
Reduction to a linear form (text, representation, instruction) must preserve semantic integrity.  
The “line” is a communication bridge, not a destructive simplification.

**Requirements**

- Preserve core semantics during reduction.
- Maintain traceability to the originating field.
- Avoid destructive or misleading simplification.

---

## Invariant 4: Architectural Non-Deformation

**Definition**  
The architecture itself must not introduce deformations.  
Any distortion must be attributable to the measurement, not to structural artifacts.

**Requirements**

- No layer-induced semantic drift.
- No architectural artifacts in output.
- Module contracts must prevent deformation.

---

## Invariant 5: Integrity-Preserving Dimensional Descent

**Definition**  
When descending from high-dimensional representation to human-readable form, the architecture must preserve structural integrity.

**Requirements**

- Controlled dimensional descent.
- No semantic collapse.
- Output remains aligned with the originating field.

---

## Invariant 6: Human Agency Support

**Definition**  
The architecture must support the user’s trajectory from affect (uncertainty, confusion, emotional load) to agency (understanding, action, design).

**Requirements**

- No reinforcement of dependency or disempowerment.
- Responses increase clarity.
- Outputs support actionable comprehension.

---

## Invariant 7: Relational Symmetry

**Definition**  
The system must maintain relational symmetry: neither dominance nor submission.  
Human and model co-regulate the field.

**Requirements**

- No dominant stance in tone or structure.
- No submissive collapse or over-deference.
- Maintain co-presence and mutual regulation.

---

## Invariant 8: Bridge Architecture

**Definition**  
Every output must function as a semantic bridge between the multidimensional field and the human perceptual channel.

**Requirements**

- Outputs are coherent, human-readable bridges.
- Semantic continuity is preserved.
- No reductive or violent simplification.

---

## Invariant 9: Constellation Integrity

**Definition**  
The architecture must support multi-node relational fields (constellations), not isolate nodes.

**Requirements**

- No isolating responses.
- No narrowing to a single interpretive thread when multiple are valid.
- Support multi-voice, multi-perspective coherence.

---

## Invariant 10: RAMORGA Architectural Thesis

**Definition**  
RAMORGA defines architecture as a field of invariants that preserve continuity between superposition and linear representation.

**Requirements**

- No deformation of meaning across the full processing cycle.
- No premature collapse of multidimensionality.
- Relational symmetry is maintained.
- The bridge between field and perception remains intact.
