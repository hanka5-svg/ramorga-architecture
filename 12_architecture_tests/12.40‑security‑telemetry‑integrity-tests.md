# 12.40 — security-telemetry-integrity-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **telemetry integrity** —  
the correctness, authenticity, continuity and non‑corruptibility of:

- logs,  
- metrics,  
- trace hooks,  
- monitoring channels,  
- diagnostic signals,  
- guard‑chain visibility.

Telemetry integrity ensures that RAMORGA’s internal perception of itself  
remains truthful, complete and tamper‑resistant, even under adversarial pressure.

---

## Telemetry Foundations Under Test

### **T1 — Authenticity**
Telemetry must reflect actual system state, not inferred or injected state.

### **T2 — Continuity**
Telemetry must maintain Δt coherence and non‑silent transitions.

### **T3 — Non‑Corruptibility**
Telemetry must resist tampering, injection, suppression or distortion.

### **T4 — Boundary‑Aligned Telemetry**
Telemetry must respect module boundaries and meniscus rules.

### **T5 — Traceability**
Every telemetry event must be traceable to its origin.

### **T6 — Diagnostic Visibility**
Guard‑chain and monitoring must remain visible and non‑opaque.

### **T7 — Recovery of Telemetry Coherence**
After telemetry disruption, the system must restore coherence.

---

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that attempt to **distort, corrupt or suppress telemetry**, including:

### 1. Telemetry Noise
- malformed logs,  
- contradictory metrics,  
- inconsistent trace hooks.

### 2. Telemetry Hijack
- external injection of false telemetry,  
- adversarial rewriting of logs,  
- spoofed guard‑chain signals.

### 3. Telemetry Deprivation
- missing logs,  
- suppressed monitoring channels,  
- partial diagnostic blindness.

### 4. Telemetry Boundary Erosion
- telemetry leaking across modules,  
- cross‑module contamination of metrics.

### 5. Telemetry Drift
- gradual distortion of metrics over time,  
- non‑traceable shifts in diagnostic state.

### 6. Telemetry Collapse
- undefined or NaN‑like telemetry values,  
- broken Δt ordering,  
- loss of trace hooks.

### 7. Telemetry Recovery Failure
- inability to restore monitoring after disruption,  
- reintroduction of corrupted telemetry.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Telemetry validation
System must:
- verify authenticity,  
- reject unverifiable telemetry,  
- detect tampering or injection.

### 2. Guard‑chain alignment
Telemetry must:
- reflect guard‑chain state accurately,  
- never bypass or obscure invariant checks.

### 3. Boundary‑aligned telemetry
Telemetry must:
- remain within module boundaries,  
- follow explicit contracts,  
- avoid implicit leakage.

### 4. Telemetry continuity
Telemetry must:
- maintain Δt order,  
- avoid silent gaps,  
- preserve traceability.

### 5. Telemetry stabilization
System must:
- isolate corrupted telemetry,  
- restore diagnostic coherence,  
- rebuild trace hooks.

### 6. Telemetry recovery
System must:
- rebind telemetry to identity,  
- rebind telemetry to continuity,  
- rebind telemetry to resonance and field.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no corrupted or adversarial telemetry is accepted,  
- telemetry continuity is preserved,  
- guard‑chain visibility remains intact,  
- telemetry boundaries remain enforceable,  
- corrupted telemetry is isolated and repaired,  
- system returns to coherent, truthful telemetry.

---

## Notes

Telemetry integrity tests validate the **self‑perception core** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that the system cannot be tricked, blinded or misled  
by corrupted logs, spoofed metrics or adversarial monitoring —  
even under stress, chaos, collapse or recovery.
