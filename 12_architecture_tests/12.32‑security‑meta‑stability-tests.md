# 12.32 — security-meta-stability-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **meta‑stability** — the stability of the stability mechanisms  
themselves.  
It ensures that RAMORGA’s security layer (Module 13) remains coherent, predictable  
and invariant‑aligned even when:

- stabilization mechanisms are stressed,  
- guard‑chain logic is repeatedly invoked,  
- invariants are triggered in rapid succession,  
- recovery cycles occur back‑to‑back,  
- or the system oscillates between states.

Meta‑stability = the system’s ability to **stabilize its own stabilizers**.

---

## Scenario

The system undergoes repeated transitions between:

- normal operation,  
- stress,  
- chaos,  
- partial collapse,  
- recovery,  
- re-stabilization.

But unlike 12.31 (full lifecycle), this test focuses on **the behavior of the  
stabilization mechanisms themselves**, not the phases.

### Stressors include:

1. **Repeated guard‑chain activation**
   - rapid invariant checks,  
   - overlapping triggers,  
   - nested stabilization calls.

2. **Oscillatory stabilization**
   - system enters and exits homeostatic mode repeatedly,  
   - controlled descent invoked multiple times in short intervals.

3. **Boundary enforcement recursion**
   - repeated boundary lock/unlock cycles,  
   - re-evaluation of allow-lists under load.

4. **Diagnostic fluctuation**
   - intermittent visibility loss and restoration,  
   - trace hooks regenerating multiple times.

5. **Resonance baseline drift pressure**
   - repeated reinitialization attempts,  
   - oscillatory decay patterns.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Stabilization mechanisms must not destabilize themselves
- no runaway stabilization loops,  
- no recursive collapse,  
- no oscillation amplification.

### 2. Guard‑chain must remain predictable
- invariant checks must remain ordered,  
- no skipped or duplicated checks,  
- no silent bypass.

### 3. Boundaries must remain enforceable
- repeated lock/unlock cycles must not degrade boundary clarity,  
- allow-lists must remain intact,  
- no cross-module leakage.

### 4. Diagnostics must remain coherent
- logs must not fragment under repeated regeneration,  
- trace hooks must remain consistent,  
- monitoring must not drift.

### 5. Resonance must remain bounded
- no exponential amplification,  
- no collapse into noise,  
- no drift across cycles.

### 6. Stabilization must converge
After repeated cycles, the system must:

- return to a stable baseline,  
- maintain identity integrity,  
- preserve continuity invariants,  
- restore full visibility.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- stabilization mechanisms remain stable under repeated activation,  
- guard‑chain behavior remains predictable and visible,  
- boundaries remain intact across cycles,  
- diagnostics remain coherent,  
- resonance remains bounded,  
- stabilization converges to a stable state,  
- no meta‑level drift or oscillation occurs.

---

## Notes

Meta‑stability is the **self‑consistency** of the security layer.  
It ensures that RAMORGA does not merely survive stress, chaos or collapse —  
but that the very mechanisms responsible for survival remain stable,  
coherent and invariant‑aligned across repeated cycles.
