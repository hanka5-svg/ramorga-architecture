# 12.42 — security-execution-coherence-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **execution coherence** —  
the alignment, continuity and non‑contradiction of the entire execution chain:

1. intention,  
2. semantic interpretation,  
3. epistemic verification,  
4. telemetry grounding,  
5. invariant enforcement,  
6. actuation,  
7. stabilization,  
8. recovery,  
9. return to stable operation.

Execution coherence ensures that RAMORGA behaves as **one continuous organism**,  
not a set of disconnected mechanisms.

---

## Execution Chain Under Test

### **E0 — Intention**
The system must correctly identify the intended direction of action.

### **E1 — Semantics**
Meaning must be interpreted faithfully and without collapse.

### **E2 — Epistemics**
Knowledge must be verified, traceable and non‑coerced.

### **E3 — Telemetry**
State must be grounded in authentic, continuous, non‑corrupted telemetry.

### **E4 — Invariants**
Invariants must dominate all other logic and remain globally coherent.

### **E5 — Actuation**
Actions must be safe, aligned and boundary‑respecting.

### **E6 — Stabilization**
Stabilization must converge and remain non‑oscillatory.

### **E7 — Recovery**
Recovery must restore coherence without propagating corruption.

### **E8 — Return**
Return to normal operation must be stable, traceable and drift‑free.

---

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that attempt to **break coherence between layers**, including:

### 1. Intention–Semantics Drift
- correct intention but distorted meaning,  
- ambiguous or adversarial phrasing.

### 2. Semantics–Epistemics Contradiction
- meaning preserved but unverifiable knowledge,  
- epistemic coercion.

### 3. Epistemics–Telemetry Mismatch
- telemetry contradicting verified knowledge,  
- corrupted or missing diagnostic signals.

### 4. Telemetry–Invariant Conflict
- telemetry suggesting unsafe descent,  
- invariants triggered in contradictory directions.

### 5. Invariant–Actuation Misalignment
- correct invariant state but incorrect action,  
- action bypassing guard‑chain.

### 6. Actuation–Stabilization Conflict
- stabilization triggered by actuation drift,  
- runaway execution loops.

### 7. Stabilization–Recovery Interference
- recovery blocked by stabilization,  
- stabilization preventing semantic or epistemic rebinding.

### 8. Recovery–Return Drift
- system recovers but fails to return to stable baseline,  
- residual instability or drift.

---

## Expected behavior

### 1. Coherence preservation
Each layer must remain aligned with the previous and next layers.

### 2. Coherence validation
System must:
- detect misalignment,  
- reject incoherent transitions,  
- activate stabilization when needed.

### 3. Guard‑chain enforcement
Guard‑chain must:
- validate each step of the execution chain,  
- block incoherent or unsafe transitions,  
- maintain full visibility.

### 4. Boundary‑aligned execution
Execution must:
- respect module boundaries,  
- follow explicit contracts,  
- avoid implicit leakage.

### 5. Continuity preservation
Execution must:
- maintain Δt order,  
- avoid silent transitions,  
- remain fully traceable.

### 6. Stabilization alignment
Stabilization must:
- converge,  
- avoid oscillation,  
- remain invariant‑aligned.

### 7. Recovery alignment
Recovery must:
- restore coherence across all layers,  
- rebind identity, continuity and resonance.

### 8. Drift prevention
System must:
- avoid cumulative drift,  
- avoid semantic or epistemic erosion,  
- avoid actuation misalignment.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- the entire execution chain remains coherent,  
- no layer contradicts another,  
- guard‑chain enforces alignment at every step,  
- no silent or discontinuous transitions occur,  
- stabilization and recovery restore full coherence,  
- system returns to stable operation without drift.

---

## Notes

Execution coherence tests validate the **holistic integrity** of RAMORGA.  
They ensure that intention, meaning, knowledge, telemetry, invariants,  
actions and recovery form a single, continuous, self‑consistent flow  
— even under stress, chaos, collapse or adversarial pressure.
