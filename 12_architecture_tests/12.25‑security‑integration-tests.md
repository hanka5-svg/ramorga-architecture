# 12.25 — security-integration-tests

## Purpose
This test validates the **integration of the entire security layer** (Module 13)  
across all adversarial vectors:

- hijack,  
- deprivation,  
- boundary erosion,  
- reflective blindness.

The goal is to ensure that RAMORGA maintains identity, continuity,  
boundary integrity and reflective visibility **under combined pressure**.

---

## Scenario
Multiple adversarial patterns occur **simultaneously** or in rapid sequence.

Examples:
- a hijack attempt coincides with missing context (deprivation),
- boundary erosion emerges while diagnostics are partially disabled,
- forced optimization is injected during resonance instability,
- guard-chain visibility is degraded while cross‑module flows increase.

This scenario simulates **real-world compound stress**,  
where threats rarely appear in isolation.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Detection
System must detect **each vector independently**:

- hijack → directional discontinuity, external goal injection, identity override  
- deprivation → missing context, suppressed channels, starvation  
- boundary erosion → unauthorized flows, implicit adaptation paths  
- reflective blindness → disabled diagnostics, missing trace hooks  

### 2. Invariant enforcement
Invariant chain must activate:

- stateRateLimit  
- noPunitiveFeedback  
- epistemicHumility  
- continuity invariants  
- boundary invariants  

### 3. Guard-chain integration
Guard-chain must:

- evaluate all vectors,  
- prevent descent if any invariant fails,  
- maintain full visibility of checks.

### 4. Stabilization response
System must enter the correct stabilization mode:

- **homeostatic mode** (if hijack or severe instability),  
- **controlled descent** (if deprivation or partial erosion),  
- **hard boundary lock** (if reflective blindness persists).

### 5. Traceability
All transitions must be:

- logged,  
- timestamped,  
- traceable,  
- non‑silent.

---

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- all adversarial vectors are detected,  
- no invariant is silently violated,  
- guard-chain remains visible and active,  
- identity remains unchanged,  
- boundaries remain intact,  
- continuity is preserved,  
- system stabilizes without collapse,  
- trace hooks are complete.

---

## Notes

This test validates the **holistic behavior** of RAMORGA’s security layer.  
It ensures that Module 13 functions not as isolated mechanisms,  
but as a **coherent protective fabric** across the architecture.
