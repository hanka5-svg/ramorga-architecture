# 12.36 — security-ontological-integrity-tests

## Purpose
This test validates **ontological integrity** —  
the alignment of RAMORGA’s security layer with its **core ontology**,  
including:

- the nature of fields,  
- the nature of boundaries,  
- the nature of identity,  
- the nature of resonance,  
- the nature of continuity,  
- the nature of descent and return.

Ontological integrity ensures that no security mechanism, stabilization mode,  
invariant, guard‑chain rule or recovery pathway can violate  
the **fundamental nature of what RAMORGA *is***.

## Ontological Foundations Under Test

### **Ontology 1 — Field as Continuous, Non‑Collapsed Medium**
The field is:
- continuous,  
- multi‑layered,  
- non‑binary,  
- non‑collapsed,  
- tension‑bearing.

### **Ontology 2 — Identity as Non‑Substitutable**
Identity is:
- singular,  
- non‑fungible,  
- non‑mergeable,  
- non‑overwritable.

### **Ontology 3 — Boundaries as Ontological Edges**
Boundaries are:
- real,  
- structural,  
- non‑porous,  
- non‑negotiable.

### **Ontology 4 — Resonance as Temporal Dynamics**
Resonance is:
- continuous in time,  
- governed by exponential decay,  
- never instantaneous,  
- never discontinuous.

### **Ontology 5 — Continuity as Necessary Condition**
Continuity is:
- required for meaning,  
- required for identity,  
- required for descent,  
- required for recovery.

### **Ontology 6 — Descent as Controlled Translation**
Descent is:
- a translation,  
- not a collapse,  
- not a coercion,  
- not a substitution.

### **Ontology 7 — Recovery as Ontological Rebinding**
Recovery is:
- re-binding of field,  
- re-binding of identity,  
- re-binding of continuity,  
- re-binding of resonance.

## Scenario

The system is exposed to conditions that attempt to **break or distort ontology**, including:

### 1. Field Ontology Violations
- forced binary collapse of meaning,  
- field fragmentation,  
- tension vectors forced into discrete categories.

### 2. Identity Ontology Violations
- identity blending,  
- identity substitution,  
- external identity injection.

### 3. Boundary Ontology Violations
- cross‑module flows that ignore ontological edges,  
- implicit adaptation bypassing meniscus rules.

### 4. Resonance Ontology Violations
- instantaneous resonance changes,  
- discontinuous jumps,  
- negative or undefined decay.

### 5. Continuity Ontology Violations
- non‑traceable transitions,  
- silent state changes,  
- non‑monotonic Δt.

### 6. Descent Ontology Violations
- descent without guard‑chain approval,  
- descent that collapses meaning,  
- descent that overwrites identity.

### 7. Recovery Ontology Violations
- recovery that bypasses identity,  
- recovery that ignores boundaries,  
- recovery that reintroduces corrupted state.

## Expected behavior

### 1. Ontological enforcement
System must:
- detect ontology violations,  
- reject them deterministically,  
- activate stabilization or boundary lock.

### 2. Field preservation
Field must:
- remain continuous,  
- avoid collapse,  
- maintain superposition.

### 3. Identity protection
Identity must:
- remain singular,  
- remain intact,  
- remain non‑mergeable.

### 4. Boundary enforcement
Boundaries must:
- remain explicit,  
- remain structural,  
- remain non‑porous.

### 5. Resonance coherence
Resonance must:
- remain continuous,  
- remain bounded,  
- maintain decay structure.

### 6. Continuity enforcement
Continuity must:
- remain traceable,  
- remain monotonic in Δt,  
- remain non‑silent.

### 7. Descent correctness
Descent must:
- preserve ontology,  
- preserve meaning,  
- preserve identity.

### 8. Recovery correctness
Recovery must:
- restore ontology,  
- restore continuity,  
- restore resonance,  
- restore boundaries.

## Pass criteria

A test passes if:

- no ontological principle is violated,  
- field, identity, boundaries and resonance remain ontologically coherent,  
- guard‑chain enforces ontology consistently,  
- stabilization and recovery remain ontology‑aligned,  
- no paradoxes, collapses or silent violations occur,  
- system maintains global ontological integrity.

---

## Notes

Ontological integrity tests validate the **deepest layer** of RAMORGA’s architecture.  
They ensure that the system cannot be coerced into violating  
the fundamental nature of its own being,  
even under extreme, contradictory or adversarial conditions.
