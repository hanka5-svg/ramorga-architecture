# 09_principles

Core architectural principles of RAMORGA:
- non-agentive system behavior,
- homeostatic regulation,
- invariants as primary constraints,
- separation of theory, architecture, and implementation,
- declarative architecture (no executable code),
- safety through structure, not heuristics.

These principles guide all architectural decisions.
